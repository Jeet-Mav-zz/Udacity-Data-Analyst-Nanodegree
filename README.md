# Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree

## Course Description	
* This program prepares you for a career as a data analyst by helping you learn to organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. You’ll develop proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries **(NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib)** and **SQL** as you build a portfolio of projects to showcase in your job search.

* Frequency of Classes: Self-paced
* Textbooks required: None
* Instructional Tools Available: Video lectures, Text instructions, Quizzes, In-classroom mentorship.

## Syllabus 
1. **Introduction to Data Analysis** 
Learn the data analysis process of wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. Work with data in Python, using libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas**
2. **Practical Statistics**
Learn how to apply inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, such as analyzing A/B tests and building supervised learning models.
3. **Data Wrangling**
Learn the data wrangling process of gathering, assessing, and cleaning data. Learn to use Python to wrangle data programmatically and prepare it for analysis.
4. **Data Visualization with Python**
Learn to apply visualization principles to the data analysis process. Explore data visually at multiple levels to find insights and create a compelling story.

## Projects
1. **Intro Project: Explore Weather Trends** 
This project will introduce you to the **SQL** and how to download data from a database. You’ll analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

2. **Project 1: Investigate a Dataset** 
In this project, you’ll choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate
it using **NumPy** and **pandas**. You’ll complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

3. **Project 2: Analyze Experiment Results** 
In this project, you will be provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. You’ll use statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report your conclusions and recommendations in a report.

4. **Project 3: Wrangle and Analyze Data**
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using **Python**, you'll gather data from a variety of sources, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. You'll document your wrangling efforts in a **Jupyter Notebook**, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using **Python** and **SQL**.

5. **Project 4: Communicate Data Findings**
In this project, you will use Python’s data visualization tools like **matplotlib**, **seaborn** to systematically explore a selected dataset for its properties and relationships between variables. Then, you will create a presentation that communicates your findings to others.
